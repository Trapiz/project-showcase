* Welcome to my game 'Pika Run'!

This game is played with a keyboard,
The `Space` or `W` key will make Pikachu jump, and he can be moved with the `A` and `D` keys. The further you move to the right edge of the screen, the more points you get! Be aware though, the hitboxes are literally boxes, so collisions aren't perfect. You can also make this game more fun to play with multiple players. Log in to be able to post your score to the leaderboard, and see other pikachu's playing live on your screen!
